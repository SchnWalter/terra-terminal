Terra Terminal Emulator
========

Terra is GTK+3.0 based terminal emulator with useful user interface, it also supports multiple terminals with splitting screen horizontally or vertically. New features will be added soon. It's very new and experimental project. I'ts written in python with python-gobject.

Terra is now able to be displayed on multi-screens at the same time.
You will get independant windows by screen.

Features added based on upstream (https://code.launchpad.net/~ozcanesen/terra/trunk):
- Use Terra Terminal on a multi-screen configuration
- Use multiple Terra Terminals on one screen
- Combine both configurations from above:
  * Multiple Terra Terminal on Multiple Screens
- Open a new Terra Terminal

Features to come:
- Save your layout configuration.
  * Almost Complete
  * At this time it doesn't save correctly tab names so next point can't be done

- Start another program at launch, saved in your layout.
  * When Layout backup will be fully operationnal

- Start a graphical program instead of a term program.
  * Might need much time if this is possible

If you want to contribute just checkout and try.
Feel free to open issues for bug report or new features.
