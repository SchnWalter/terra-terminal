Terra Terminal Emulator
========

Terra is GTK+3.0 based terminal emulator with useful user interface, it also supports multiple terminals with splitting screen horizontally or vertically. New features will be added soon. It's very new and experimental project. I'ts written in python with python-gobject.

Terra is now able to be displayed on multi-screens at the same time.
You will get independant windows by screen.


Features to come:
- Save your layout.
- Start other program at launch, saved in your layout
- Start a graphical program instead of a term program.


If you want to contribute just checkout and try.
